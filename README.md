# Unsloth Inference Guide

Since I am going to fine tune different models and mostly locally, I preferred a fast and optimized way. `unsloth` is the best way possible, but most of the codes on the internet are very specialized towards the model they try to fine tune. 

Then, I decided to make a code base where people with a little bit of change in the code base, be able to at least do the inference phase. So in this code this is possible.
